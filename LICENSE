AIgentOS uses a split-license model.

Why this split exists:
- The kernel is the core OSS engine. We want improvements to kernel source files to remain public when redistributed.
- The WebUI and prompt packs are optional layers. We want adopters to customize them freely for product-specific experiences.

License by directory:
- `kernel/` -> Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
  - Full text: `kernel/MPL-2.0-LICENSE`
- `agent-webui/` -> Apache License 2.0
  - Full text: `agent-webui/APACHE-2.0-LICENSE`
- `agent-prompts/` -> Apache License 2.0
  - Full text: `agent-prompts/APACHE-2.0-LICENSE`

Interpretation intent (plain language):
- If you modify and redistribute files in `kernel/`, those modified MPL-covered files must remain available under MPL-2.0.
- Changes made only in `agent-webui/` or `agent-prompts/` are governed by Apache-2.0 for those directories.
- You can build proprietary code around this repository as long as you comply with the license terms of files you use or modify.

For legal terms, always refer to the full license texts above.
